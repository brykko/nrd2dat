- New configurable parameters: input_range, lowcut, buffer_size
- High-pass filter changed from IIR butterworth to exponential moving average (same as Neuralynx "DCO")
- Each run of nrd2dat now generates a log file for future reference
- Digital IO port states are now written to an additional output binary file
- Sample frequency, AD channel count, record size and AD-bit-volts are determined from raw file header

IMPORTANT! The default low-cut frequency has been changed from 100 Hz to 0.1 Hz. This change means that
both spike-band and lfp-band signals may be extracted from the output samples data file. The dynamic 
range required to save the lower-frequency signal components is larger than for high frequencies, so 
the signal must be downscaled a little more to avoid clipping. The scaling factor is determined by the 
"input_range" parameter, which is 2000 uV by default, but can be set as an input parameter.
